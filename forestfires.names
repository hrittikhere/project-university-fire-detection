   In the above reference, the output "area" was first transformed with a ln(x+1) function.
   Then, several Data Mining methods were applied. After fitting the models, the outputs were
   post-processed with the inverse of the ln(x+1) transform. Four different input setups were
   used. The experiments were conducted using a 10-fold (cross-validation) x 30 runs. Two
   regression metrics were measured: MAD and RMSE. A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fed
   with only 4 direct weather conditions (temp, RH, wind and rain) obtained the best MAD value:
   12.71 +- 0.01 (mean and confidence interval within 95% using a t-student distribution). The
   best RMSE was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis to the regression error curve
   (REC) shows that the SVM model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error. In effect,
   the SVM model predicts better small fires, which are the majority. 
 
4. Relevant Information:

   This is a very difficult regression task. It can be used to test regression methods. Also,
   it could be used to test outlier detection methods, since it is not clear how many outliers
   are there. Yet, the number of examples of fires with a large burned area is very small.

5. Number of Instances: 517 

6. Number of Attributes: 12 + output attribute
  
   Note: several of the attributes may be correlated, thus it makes sense to apply some sort of
   feature selection.

7. Attribute information:

      X - x-axis spatial coordinate: This represents a spatial coordinate on the x-axis within the Montesinho park map. The values range from 1 to 9.

      Y - y-axis spatial coordinate: This represents a spatial coordinate on the y-axis within the Montesinho park map. The values range from 2 to 9.

      day: This represents the day of the week and is encoded with three-letter abbreviations, ranging from "mon" to "sun."

      FFMC - Fine Fuel Moisture Code: This is an index from the Fire Weather Index (FWI) system, representing the moisture content of fine fuels. The values range from 18.7 to 96.20.

      DMC - Duff Moisture Code: Another index from the FWI system, representing the moisture content of decomposed organic material. The values range from 1.1 to 291.3.

      DC - Drought Code: This is part of the FWI system and represents the drought effect on deep, compact organic layers. The values range from 7.9 to 860.6.

      ISI - Initial Spread Index: This is an index from the FWI system, representing the expected rate of fire spread. The values range from 0.0 to 56.10.

      temp - Temperature: This represents the temperature in Celsius degrees. The values range from 2.2 to 33.30.

      RH - Relative Humidity: This represents the relative humidity in percentage (%). The values range from 15.0 to 100.

      wind - Wind Speed: This represents the wind speed in kilometers per hour (km/h). The values range from 0.40 to 9.40.

      rain - Outside Rain: This represents the amount of rain in millimeters per square meter (mm/m2). The values range from 0.0 to 6.4.

      area - Burned Area: This is the output variable and represents the burned area of the forest in hectares (ha). The values range from 0.00 to 1090.84. The note suggests that this variable is highly skewed towards 0.0, and it may be beneficial to model it with a logarithmic transform.

8. Missing Attribute Values: None
